# Git Training

The object of this module is to teach you some basics on how to use Git, at least to manage files and folders in a repository, across branches.

1. Install git on your computer and make sure you can call it from the command prompt (Terminal on MacOS, Command Line on Linux, cmd/Command Prompt on Windows).
2. Clone this repository (Git-Training) - you may have to set git.config parameters on your command prompt.
   - Hint: HTTPS Cloning link is https://github.com/Avionics-Propulsion-Landers-GT/Git-Training.git
4.  Create a branch with your name and initials (eg., for John Doe, your branch name should be set to 'John-D')
5. Use git checkout to move to that branch.
6. Add a file with your name ('John-D') as the filename, commit it, and push it to YOUR branch (not main)
7. Finally, make a separate push to put your branch up to date with the main branch.

Let me know if you have any questions! You can reach me on Discord or over text using the phone number found on the Avionics channel.

Try to do all of this from the command prompt, not on GitHub!

For some help, look at https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. In general, when you run into a problem, copy over the error message you get from the command prompt and use Google! Stack Overflow and other forums are GREAT for debugging. If you're stuck, reach out to me! I cannot stress how important this process is, you'll be using Git every time you update a PCB design.
