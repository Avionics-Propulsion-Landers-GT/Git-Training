# Git Training

The object of this module is to teach you some basics on how to use Git, at least to manage files and folders in a repository, across branches.

1. Install git on your computer and make sure you can call it from the command prompt (Terminal on MacOS, Command Line on Linux, cmd/Command Prompt on Windows).
2. Clone this repository (Git-Training) - you may have to set git.config parameters on your command prompt.
   - Hint: HTTPS Cloning link is https://github.com/Avionics-Propulsion-Landers-GT/Git-Training.git
4.  Create a branch with your name and initials (eg., for John Doe, your branch name should be set to 'John-D')
5. Use git checkout to move to that branch.
6. Add a file with your name ('John-D') as the filename, commit it, and push it to YOUR branch (not main)
7. Finally, make a separate push to put your branch up to date with the main branch.
8. **Optional:** Just to help you understand how useful version control can be, if someone else has completed the exercise AFTER you (meaning you're revisiting this, or I've updated the instructions again) there's an additional step you can play around with. If they have completed their steps correctly, and have merged their branch with the main branch, it can be interesting to see what happens when you try to update your branch. To do this, try to move to your branch again from main (git checkout). Now you're back to working on your branch again, try git merge master (or main, depending on your installation).

Let me know if you have any questions! You can reach me on Discord or over text using the phone number found on the Avionics channel.

Try to do all of this from the command prompt, not on GitHub!

For some help, look at https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. In general, when you run into a problem, copy over the error message you get from the command prompt and use Google! Stack Overflow and other forums are GREAT for debugging. If you're stuck, reach out to me! I cannot stress how important this process is, you'll be using Git every time you update a PCB design.
